D. Pre-Signed URL
https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/unstructured-intro
Used to download or access files without authenticating into Snowflake or passing an authorization token. Pre-signed URLs are open; any user or
application can directly access or download the files. Ideal for business intelligence applications or reporting tools that need to display the
unstructured file contents.
Any person who has the pre-signed URL can access the referenced file for the life of the token.

Correct Answer: D. Share
Share: In Snowflake, a share is a first-class object that encapsulates all the necessary information to share a database or specific objects within a
database with other Snowflake accounts. This includes the databases, schemas, tables, views, and other database objects that are being shared. The
share object allows providers to define what data to share and manage access to that shared data.

The parameter that can be set at the account level to set the minimum number of days for which Snowflake retains historical data in Time Travel is
A. DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS. This parameter allows you to specify how long Snowflake retains the historical data, enabling you to access
and query data from past states of tables within the specified time frame.

Not quite. ""MIN_DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS"" is set at the account level. ""DATA_RETENTION_TIME_IN_DAYS"" is set at the object level
(database, schema, table). the question is asking for the former, so the answer is C.

And I think it is C. The key word in the question is 'selectively', I understand it so that the masking policy masks only part of values in a given
column, when actually the masking policy masks ALL values in a given column for a particular role.
So, if you have Role_A, you either see full values (for example: email addresses) or masked values.

A. It selectively masks plain text data - because conditional data masking does involve selectively masking data based on certain conditions or
criteria. However, it's important to clarify that these conditions are often related to user roles or other security measures rather than the content of
the data itself. The key feature of conditional data masking is its ability to dynamically display either the original data or a masked version of the
data based on the evaluation of these conditions.

The order of precedence (highest to lowest) of network policies when applied at the account, user, and security integrations layers in Snowflake is:
D. User, account, security integration
Explanation:
User: Network policies applied at the user level have the highest precedence. This allows specific users to have tailored network policies that
override broader policies.
Account: Network policies applied at the account level come next in precedence. These policies apply to all users within the account unless
overridden by user-specific policies.
Security integration: Network policies applied at the security integration level have the lowest precedence. These policies typically apply to
integrations and third-party services accessing the account.

B. Enable the query acceleration service.
The query acceleration service dynamically adds additional compute resources (more CPU and memory) to a virtual warehouse when queries
require more resources than initially allocated. This can be a cost-effective solution as it only scales up resources temporarily during peak demand,
potentially reducing memory spillage without the need to permanently increase the warehouse size.

Selected Answer: AC
at the Snowflake billing layer your storage charge is simply a flat $/TB‑month rate, and that published rate only varies by:
Account type (On‑Demand vs Capacity pre‑purchase)
Region (US, EU, APAC, etc.)
All of the “cloud platform” differences are already baked into the single per‑TB list prices Snowflake publishes; you as a customer simply pick
On‑Demand or Capacity and a region, and you pay that flat rate. The other choices (file format, data type, underlying provider) don’t change your
Snowflake‑billed per‑TB price.

Explanation:
TO_JSON is used to convert relational data into JSON format, which is ideal when unloading a relational table into a JSON file.
Why the others are wrong:
A. PARSE_JSON: This function is used to parse a JSON string into a Snowflake-compatible format, not for converting relational data into JSON.
B. JSON_EXTRACT_PATH_TEXT: This function extracts specific values from JSON data, but it doesn't convert relational data into JSON.
C. OBJECT_CONSTRUCT: This creates a JSON object from key-value pairs, but it doesn't convert the entire relational data into JSON format.
Example of using TO_JSON:
SELECT TO_JSON(OBJECT_CONSTRUCT(*)) FROM my_table;

Selected Answer: C
Excessive spillage in the Query Profile—where intermediate data “spills” from RAM to SSD or even remote cloud storage—means your warehouse
ran out of memory for the query. In other words, it’s a clear sign of improper virtual warehouse sizing (option C), not an issue with CTEs, temporary
tables, or general query logic.
When a warehouse’s RAM is exhausted during sorts, joins, or aggregations, Snowflake writes intermediate blocks to local SSD (and then to remote
storage if needed), which shows up as high “Bytes Spilled” in the profile.
Spillage to local or remote storage drastically slows execution and indicates you need a larger warehouse (more memory) to keep data in‑memory.
Snowflake documentation and community best practices uniformly recommend increasing warehouse size if you observe significant spillage
metrics.

Selected Answer: C
When unloading data into a stage in Snowflake, the FILE_EXTENSION file format option specifies the extension for the output files (e.g., .csv for CSV
files or .json for JSON files). While the TYPE parameter (e.g., CSV or JSON) defines the format itself, FILE_EXTENSION explicitly controls the file
extension. This ensures the output files are saved with the correct format-specific suffix.
Why the other options are incorrect:
A. PARSE_HEADER: Used during data loading (not unloading) to parse headers in CSV files.
B. TRIM_SPACE: Trims whitespace during data loading, irrelevant to unloading.
D. SKIP_HEADER: Skips header rows during loading, not applicable to unloading.
FILE_EXTENSION is the only option directly tied to defining the output file format when unloading data.

Selected Answer: CD
C. Local and In‑Transit Encryption
Snowflake’s client library automatically encrypts files on the user’s local machine before they’re sent to an internal stage. In addition, all data in
transit is protected via TLS, ensuring end‑to‑end encryption before the data even reaches Snowflake’s cloud storage.
D. Automated Key Rotation with HSMs
Snowflake uses a hierarchical key model—root keys, account master keys, table master keys, and file keys—all managed in FIPS‑validated hardware
security modules (HSMs). The service automatically rotates these keys on a regular schedule and can periodically re‑encrypt stored data
(“rekeying”) without any customer intervention.
